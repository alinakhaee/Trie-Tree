# Trie-Tree
Trie is a type of tree structure that is perfectly fits and widely used for word searching.
I write this code for a project in data structures lesson in university. 

## How to run
just edit the text in the test.txt and run the program and enter the word you want to search in text. then the program will find all the occurence of the word in the text.
this search will be done in much much less time than the actual time required. because of the structure of trie.
